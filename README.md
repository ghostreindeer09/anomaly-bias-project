Here's a clean and professional `README.md` file for your **Anomaly-Bias-Project** on GitHub. It summarizes the purpose, features, usage, and setup instructions:

# Anomaly Bias Project

This project is an interactive anomaly detection tool that helps uncover hidden insights in datasets using clustering algorithms and a custom visualization of survivorship bias. Built with Streamlit, it allows users to upload CSV files, select features, detect anomalies, and visualize patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.

## 🔍 What It Does

1. **Detects Anomalies:**  
   Uses KMeans clustering to detect outliers (unusual data points) based on user-selected features.

2. **Survivorship Bias Visualization:**  
   Highlights how excluding certain data (like failed or ignored entries) can mislead analysis — helps correct for those biases.

3. **Interactive Visualizations:**  
   Generates two intuitive graphs:
   - Clustering-based anomaly detection
   - Survivorship bias distribution (e.g., score vs. condition)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghostreindeer09/anomaly-bias-project.git
cd anomaly-bias-project
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 Use Case

Suppose you're looking to buy a car within a certain budget. The app:

* Finds options that fit your range
* Checks past customer data (e.g., conditions, scores)
* Alerts you to any misleading trends (e.g., models that seem great only because failures were filtered out)

> 💡 In one line: **This project helps avoid misleading decisions by correcting for survivorship bias.**

## 🛠 Built With
